# Pevensie: A MonoGame Example
This is a basic example of a game created using the **MonoGame Game Engine** ([link](https://monogame.net)). This is just a fun personal project, it is untelling when it will be updated. Still, I think it provides some basic examples for some useful things in MonoGame.

# Features
- Move a square around the screen
- Change the color of the square
- GamePad support
- Keyboard support

# Development
## Software
- VS Code (technically VS Codium)
- Arch Linux (I use Arch, btw)
- .NET 7 (will likely move to .NET 8 soon)

## Hardware
- NVIDIA GTX 1660
- Intel 13700KF

# Known Bugs
- KDE Plasma fucks up other windows after the game is closed during debugging. This is fixed by moving the windows around.

# Notes (mainly for myself)
- You need to run `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-mgcb-editor ` to install the mgcb editor.
